# SpriteEditor
[Free browser tool for spritesheet alignment](https://alekseyfadeev.github.io/SpriteEditor/)

This is a simple tool that runs in your browser to create clean sprite sheets. It's convenient for working with sprite sheets generated by neural networks to achieve pixel-perfect object alignment.

All operations are performed in your browser, and your data is never sent anywhere :)
